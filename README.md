## Pocket Poetry

My app is named Pocket Poetry; it's a personal archive to write and/or record poetry. I tried to recreate the aesthetics of old typewriter paper to enhance the viewer's experience. On the home page, it includes a few buttons to other well-known online platforms that offer huge archives for the user's convenience.

I've added a few example poems in the database to test-run the app, which can be seen in the "Browse" section.

## Functions

The user can write down poems from established authors along with the title of the poem, poet, and the date the poem was written. Not all of the queries are required to create an entry, so they can be flexible with unknown information such as an anonymous poet or an unknown date.

If desired, the user can also write their own poems and keep it in the archives. Reading, updating, and deleting individual entries are all possible.

There is also a search bar in the Browse tab, allowing the user to search for poems in their archive using any keyword, including the title of the poem, text in the actual poem, the name of the poet, and even the date the poem was written on.

## Link to app

This is the [link](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~jl11695/7-web-app-SkyeJayleen/flask.cgi) to the app, however I could not get the app to be published on i6; therefore I will send in a separate .env file I used to set up the app to have the app run locally using MongoDB Atlas.
