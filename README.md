## Pocket Poetry

My app is named Pocket Poetry; it's a personal archive to write and/or record poetry. I tried to recreate the aesthetics of old typewriter paper to enhance the viewer's experience.

I've added a few example poems to test-run the app.

## Functions

The user can write down poems from established authors along with the title of the poem, poet, and the date the poem was written. Not all of the queries are required to create an entry, so they can be flexible with unknown information such as an anonymous poet or an unknown date.

If desired, the user can also write their own poems and keep it in the archives. Reading, updating, and deleting individual entries are all possible.

There is also a search bar in the Browse tab, allowing the user to search for poems in their archive using any keyword, including the title of the poem, text in the actual poem, the name of the poet, and even the date the poem was written on.
